                    <p><img src="./images/portrait.PNG" alt="Portrait"> Hello, I am budding developer from Miami Florida. I became interested in web development after working in a digital marketing agency, in sales. I was constantly working directly with our web development team, and learned through the grapevine the basics of how websites work. I slowly became more and more intrigued with the web development process, and here I am!</p>
            
                    <p>I was born in Miami, raised in London, and moved back 5 years ago. I worked in a number of different industries but found my path more in sales and digital marketing. I hope to, upon graduating this course, start a new career path as a web developer. I also have aspirations of running a small fereelance agency in my freetime.</p>
